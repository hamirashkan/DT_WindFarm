Industry 4.0 digital twin for offshore wind farm


An interactive digital twin platform for onshore and offshore wind farms. The digital twin platform is combined with augmented reality to enhance user experience. The platform is based on OPC UA for communication, Unity 3D for simulation and visualization, and Vuforia for augmented reality. To this end, we use the Hywind Tampen wind farm as a use case. The Hywind Tampen consists of 11 wind turbines and has a combined capacity of 88MW. Users can change the wind speed and direction, as well as the associated geometry and capacity of each wind turbines. These features enable the users to simulate different scenarios related to further development and optimization of the wind farm.
